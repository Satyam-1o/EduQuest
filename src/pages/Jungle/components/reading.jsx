          The <span className="text-[#B4E50D]">Amazon Rainforest</span> is the largest rainforest in the world,
          stretching across nine countries in South America. Rainforests are
          important because they act as the “lungs of the Earth,” releasing a
          huge amount of oxygen through the process of photosynthesis, where
          plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to make their own food.
          A rainforest has four main layers. The emergent layer is made of the
          tallest trees, which receive the most sunlight. Below it lies the
          canopy, a thick roof that houses most of the animals. The understory
          is dark and humid, while the forest floor is the darkest layer, with
          very little sunlight reaching the ground. Rainforests are home to many
          amazing animals. The lion is called the “king of the jungle,” though
          lions mostly live in grasslands. The Sundarbans mangrove forest in
          India and Bangladesh is especially famous for its Bengal tigers, the
          largest tiger population in the world. Some animals in jungles are
          nocturnal, meaning they are active at night, such as bats, owls, and
          jaguars. Not all jungle creatures are large—some of the most dangerous
          are tiny. The mosquito spreads deadly diseases like malaria and
          dengue, making it one of the biggest threats to life in rainforests.
          Even though rainforests cover less than 10% of Earth’s land, they are
          home to nearly 50% of all living species. This makes them one of the
          most diverse and important ecosystems on the planet.
